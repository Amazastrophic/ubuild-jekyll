  headline: Welcome the the luxury metaverse
  content: "<p></p><p>Sage Towers is a free, community driven metaverse experiment
    thatâ€™s focused on verified NFT ownership, web3 and realtime multiplayer interactions.
    Our long term goal is to open up as much of our core work as we can to help create
    the ultimate Metaverse. We are using as much open source as we can already along
    with Unity for platform support. Our core game can support hundreds of players
    on a huge beautiful open world server with player base building. Web3 support
    is being polished out before we push this metaverse much more.</p><p>Currently
    we are building one-off meme metaverses that are creative common license focused,
    with a private GitHub going public for everyone when a special NFT gets sold.
    We hope to help build out directly and indirectly by creating these projects and
    iterating on there core meme factors. The foundations of the metaverse need to
    become grounded is some fashion, allow it to be the modern renaissance of meme
    art.</p><p>We have no funding source backing us and are core gamers. We do not
    wish to have crypto  transactions and NFTs shoveled into our faces like mobile
    games did and do. There is a place and a time everything and we think we can get
    there. The current goal should be a true open metaverse with an open source codebase
    so vast it's hard to imagine. Our monetary gains are second place to the core
    mission and that's why you chose to create unique NFT sales to sustain the two
    people who currently work at Amazastrophic.</p>"
